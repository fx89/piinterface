# These are the pins available to the application.
# If any of the pins are being used for other purposes, they should be removed from this list.
# If there are any more free pins not in this list, they can be added.
# The GPIO id can be changed to whatever number if users prefer to have a custom identifier for the pins
#
# The "isSignalInverted" attribute can have the values 0 and 1. If set to 1, then the service
# will set the pin status to OFF when required to set it to ON and vice versa. This can be
# used with cheap devices having a status indicator that turns on when the pin state is set to
# GPIO.LOW and off when the pin state is set to GPIO.HIGH
